        <div class="divspan">
            <span class="span-second-headline">A key driver of youtubeability is <strong> the clarity of
                    yourgameplay</strong> to a potential player.
                <br> <br> Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting
                the
                <strong> lowest possible CPIs </strong> for your games. <br> <br> Many elements can be used to make your
                game
                clearer: <br> <br> For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte -raction with the game is
                <strong>evident</strong>, for example,
                can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong>
                Does it
                look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                seconds
                (too long!). <br> <br>
                Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                Jump,
                obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a
                threat.</span>

                If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the street, it is
                interesting
                to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to <strong> understand
                    their</strong> expectations from the video vs. the actual game they try. <br> <br> <strong> Make it
                    obvious</strong> with visual elements that hel <strong>understand the objective and controls
                </strong>
                of the game,
                like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the
                space
                dedicated to drawing.

                People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong> on their phone’s Facebook
                    feed,</strong>
                everything will seem smaller than
                when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
                <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone
                    watches iton a small screen. </strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is
                an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong>
                <br> <br>
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a
                random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same
                idea for your game videos.
